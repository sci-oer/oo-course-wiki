#### Advanced

##### Generics

The use of parameterized types (Generics)  increases the type-safety of an OO program.  In this section we learn how to create our own Generic types and use them. 

 - [Intro to Generics](generics/introToGenerics)
 


#####  Functional Programming

Functional programming has many similarities with OO programming.  In this section you will learn about the functional programming conventions that are availble in the Java programming language and how they can be used to improve the overall design of your OO program.

## About the Resource
#### Authors
This resource was created by Dr. J. McCuaig and M. Asch.   C. Norrie and H. Al-Rubaye were employed  as summer students to author wiki pages and create activity solutions.  

Students from the Fall 2022 offering of Intro to Object-Oriented Programming at the University of Guelph provided valuable bug reports and feedback about the resource.  Thanks also to OO students who contributed code including M. Schmid, B. Sengupta, M. Ladyjenko, and R. Blotsky.

This project wasmade possible with funding from the University of Guelph OER support program and the Government of Ontario and through eCampusOntarioâ€™s support of the Virtual Learning Strategy. To learn more about the Virtual Learning Strategy visit: https://vls.ecampusontario.ca.


#### Learning Outcomes
Once you master the concepts contained in these resources you will be able to:
 - Differentiate between procedural and object-oriented paradigms
 - Design and implement classes for an object-oriented program demonstrating correct use of encapsulation, constructors, method overloading, class invariants, accessors, mutators, instance variables and class variables.
 - Construct class hierarchies that maximize code reuse through inheritance while accommodating differences through method overriding.
 -  Describe polymorphism and identify situations in which it is used in an OO program. .
 -  Use polymorphism, abstract methods/classes, and interfaces effectively to produce reusable, clean code.
 -  Read and understand class diagrams written in UML (Unified Modeling Language)
 -  Compare event-driven programming with  process-driven programming.
