# About this SCIOER resource

This resource is part of an investigation into a semi-automated process for creating Self-Contained, Interactive Open Educational Resources (SCIOER) for use by students and instructors in the discipline of Computer Science. Resources created through the SCIOER process are self-contained and provide all the tools necessary for learners. The interactive nature of the resource encourages experimentation and incremental practice. Learners are able to annotate SCIOER resources with their personal observations and learnings.

More information about this and other SCIOER resources is available:

This project is made possible with funding from the University of Guelph OER support program and the Government of Ontario and through eCampusOntarioâ€™s support of the Virtual Learning Strategy. To learn more about the Virtual Learning Strategy visit: https://vls.ecampusontario.ca.
