### Practice Problem

Start with your solution to the problem posed in the practice activities for [Event Handlers](/practiceActivities/eventDrivenProgramming/eventHandlers).    Modify that application so that the user can input text via the GUI and that text is used to update the string variable.     Further modify the application so that it is more visually appealing.  Change the layout mangers to make a more appealing layout.  Use colour and borders to group components visually.


Extra practice:  Turn the application into a todo list by adding a [`JList`](http://localhost:8000/docs/api/java.desktop/javax/swing/JList.html) component and allowing the user input to add to the list.
