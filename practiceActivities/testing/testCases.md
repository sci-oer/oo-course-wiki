### Practice Problem
Start with your solution to the calculator problem post in Practice Activities for [Instance Variables](/practiceActivities/ooConcepts/variables).  

Add the following features to the calculator class:
- a memory that stores a value for later retrieval.  Include methods for pushing to the memory and popping from it.  
- a method for taking the square root of a number

Create a document that lists possible test cases for every method in the revised calculator class.    Make a separate table for each method.  You can use the markdown template below if you wish.

#### MethodName
| Category | specific test case| Expected result
|---|---|---|
| e.g. negative numbers | `-1` | whatever the result is |
| ... | ... |...|
