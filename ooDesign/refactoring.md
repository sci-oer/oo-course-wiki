# Refactoring
**parts of section were first written by ChatGPT and then edited by the book author**

Refactoring is the process of improving the design and structure of existing code without changing its external behavior. It is an essential skill that helps developers create cleaner, more maintainable code. 

Refactoring is driven by the goal of improving code quality and enhancing maintainability. It involves identifying and eliminating code smells, which are indicators of potential design issues in your code. Code smells are specific patterns or characteristics that suggest there might be a problem. Some common code smells include long methods, duplicated code, and long parameter lists. These code smells can make your code harder to understand, modify, and extend.

To guide the process of refactoring, we have the SOLID principles, which provide a set of guidelines for writing clean, modular, and maintainable code. Let's briefly discuss the SOLID principles and their general ideas:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change. It means that each class should have a single responsibility or purpose. By adhering to this principle, your code becomes more focused, modular, and easier to understand and maintain.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification. It means that you should be able to add new functionality to your code without changing its existing behavior. This principle promotes the use of interfaces, abstractions, and design patterns to achieve extensibility.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types without affecting the correctness of the program. It ensures that derived classes can be used interchangeably with their base classes without causing errors or unexpected behavior.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. It advocates for small, focused interfaces tailored to the specific needs of clients, rather than large, monolithic interfaces.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. This principle promotes loose coupling and dependency injection, allowing for easier testing, maintenance, and flexibility.

Now, let's focus on the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) from the SOLID principles. The SRP states that a class should have only one reason to change. This means that each class should have a single responsibility or purpose. By adhering to this principle, you can make your code more focused, modular, and easier to understand and maintain.

Let's explore some specific examples of refactoring based on the Single Responsibility Principle:

### Example  - Long Methods:

This example that demonstrates a long method for calculating character count, word count, and whitespace count in a file, and how it can be refactored into smaller, more manageable methods

Before refactoring:

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileAnalyzer {
    public void analyzeFile(String filePath) {
        try {
            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath));
            String line;
            int charCount = 0;
            int wordCount = 0;
            int whitespaceCount = 0;

            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                charCount += line.length();

                String[] words = line.split(" ");
                wordCount += words.length;

                for (char c : line.toCharArray()) {
                    if (Character.isWhitespace(c)) {
                        whitespaceCount++;
                    }
                }
            }

            System.out.println("Character count: " + charCount);
            System.out.println("Word count: " + wordCount);
            System.out.println("Whitespace count: " + whitespaceCount);

            reader.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

```

After refactoring:

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileAnalyzer {
    public void analyzeFile(String filePath) {
        try {
            BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath));
            int charCount = 0;
            int wordCount = 0;
            int whitespaceCount = 0;
            String line;

            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                charCount += calculateCharacterCount(line);
                wordCount += calculateWordCount(line);
                whitespaceCount += calculateWhitespaceCount(line);
            }

            displayResults(charCount, wordCount, whitespaceCount);

            reader.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    private int calculateCharacterCount(String line) {
        return line.length();
    }

    private int calculateWordCount(String line) {
        String[] words = line.split(" ");
        return words.length;
    }

    private int calculateWhitespaceCount(String line) {
        int count = 0;
        for (char c : line.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isWhitespace(c)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    private void displayResults(int charCount, int wordCount, int whitespaceCount) {
        System.out.println("Character count: " + charCount);
        System.out.println("Word count: " + wordCount);
        System.out.println("Whitespace count: " + whitespaceCount);
    }
}

```

In the refactored version, the original long method analyzeFile() has been broken down into smaller, more focused methods:

- `calculateCharacterCount()` computes the number of characters in a given line.
- `calculateWordCount()` calculates the number of words in a given line.
- `calculateWhitespaceCount()` determines the count of whitespace characters in a given line.
- `displayResults()` is responsible for displaying the final results.

By dividing the functionality into smaller methods, each with a single responsibility, the code becomes more modular and easier to understand. Additionally, it allows for better code reuse and testability.



### Example - Long Parameter Lists:

Before refactoring:

```java
public class Order {
    public void placeOrder(String itemName, String itemDescription, double itemPrice, int quantity) {
        // Perform validation checks
        if (itemName == null || itemName.isEmpty()) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Item name cannot be empty");
        }

        if (itemPrice <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Item price must be greater than zero");
        }

        if (quantity <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Quantity must be greater than zero");
        }

        // Calculate the total price
        double totalPrice = itemPrice * quantity;


        // Process the order (e.g., save to database, notify shipping, etc.)
        // ...
        // Code for processing the order

        // Display order summary
        System.out.println("Order placed successfully:");
        System.out.println("Item: " + itemName);
        System.out.println("Description: " + itemDescription);
        System.out.println("Price per item: $" + itemPrice);
        System.out.println("Quantity: " + quantity);
        System.out.println("Total price: $" + totalPrice);
    }
}

```

To refactor the code we create an `Item` class that has the responsibility of keeping track of the characteristics of the items for sale and an `Order` class that keeps track of the orders.

The long parameter list is removed because the necessary information is now encapsulated in an object.  Additionally, the objects involved in this computation now each have a single responsiblity.

```java
public class Item {
    private String name;
    private String description;
    private double price;

    public Item(String name, String description, double price) {
        this.name = name;
        this.description = description;
        this.price = price;
    }

    // Getters and setters for the Item properties

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }

    public void setDescription(String description) {
        this.description = description;
    }

    public double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }

    public void setPrice(double price) {
        this.price = price;
    }
}
```

```java
public class Order {
    private Item item;
    private int quantity;

    public Order(Item item, int quantity) {
        this.item = item;
        this.quantity = quantity;
    }

    public void placeOrder() {
        // Perform validation checks
        if (item == null) {
            throw new IllegalStateException("Item cannot be null");
        }

        if (quantity <= 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Quantity must be greater than zero");
        }

        // Calculate the total price
        double totalPrice = item.getPrice() * quantity;

        // Process the order (e.g., save to database, notify shipping, etc.)
        // ...
        // Code for processing the order

        // Display order summary
        System.out.println("Order placed successfully:");
        System.out.println("Item: " + item.getName());
        System.out.println("Description: " + item.getDescription());
        System.out.println("Price per item: $" + item.getPrice());
        System.out.println("Quantity: " + quantity);
        System.out.println("Total price: $" + totalPrice);
    }
}
```
By understanding and applying the Single Responsibility Principle, you can create more maintainable and modular code. Remember, refactoring is an ongoing process, and it's essential to continuously evaluate and improve your codebase.
