# Using Jupyter Lab Practice Pages

JupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment that supports several different programming languages. We will be using it for learning coding concepts, and practicing writing solutions in small step tutorials throughout your progression in the course.

### What does a tutorial look like?

Here in this image you can see what the tutorial page for **Programming with Polymorphism** looks like inside of `Jupyter Lab`. You can see text explaining a concept and how it leads into sample code that is provided for you to get a better understanding of the concept being taught. 

### Practicing with Jupyter Lab

In order to see how using `Jupyter Lab` to compile your solutions to problems works, let's take a look at the **Hello World** tutorial.

As you can see in the image above, there is a solution to a Hello World program in Java. In order to run your solution:

1. Make sure your kernel in the top right corner is set to `Java11`.
2. Highlight your cells that you wish to run such as the blue highlight above.
3. click on the play button in the tool bar to run your solution.
(see image below for outcome)

As you can see in the image above, the solution to the Hello World program in Java has been run and the output for the program has been printed below the solution.

Also if you wish to edit or write code into a coding cell on `Jupyter Lab` all you need to do is double click on the cell. Once you are in the cell all your changes are automatically saved and will be updated for you the next time you run the kernel.
