# Text Editors
It is useful to know how to create software using only a text editor because occasionally we find ourselves writing or editing software over a non-graphical network connection.   

A text editor that is designed for creating software is much preferrable to a general purpose text editor.   Traditionally, software developers have used variations on Vim or Emacs as non graphical editors.

Sublime text editor is a powerful editor for writing code that is easier for beginners to learn than either Emacs or Vim.   It is a good starting point for learning to use a text editor.

### Sublime Text
Sublime Text is a source code editor that supports many programming and markup languages. It is one of the most popular code editors available, due to its vast amounts of built in feautures and extendability allowing for it to be whatever you need it to be for your programming needs.

#### Writing Code With Sublime Text
Sublime allows for you to write and edit source code. **Please remember that it is important to SAVE often!** It comes packed with helpful tools such as **Auto-completion**, and quickly inserting text & code with Sublime Text Snippets. It allows for you to compile and run code right in the terminal in the app. As well as manage your files for the project you are working on on the left side-bar. (See image below for these two features mentioned)

### Using Auto-Completion
 The Auto-Completion tool works as promptly and effortless as you would expect in Sublime Text. It provides drop down bars with completions of variable names, methods, etc. that your project has access to as you write your code. Simply hovering over the option you would like auto-completed and clicking on it, or just arrowing down to it and pressing `Tab` or `Enter` will complete this action.

## Compiling and Running with a text editor

**Step 1 -** Open Sublime text 
 
**Step 2 -** go to files, then click open folder and choose a folder, or just click (ctrl + o) and choose a folder

**Step 3 -** click terminal option from menu above then click new terminal.

**Step 4 -** cd into the directory of the project.
 
**Step 5 -** If its a gradle folder (all the examples and projects attached to this website are gradle folders) Run`./gradlew build`
