# Planning your course
This resource has been designed to be a self-contained system that requires little to no internet access. This makes it suitable for situations where the student has limited internet availability.

Each of the concepts presented in this set of resources has a page in this wiki that contains written notes about the concept as well as links to a variety of practice activities and short video presentations.
