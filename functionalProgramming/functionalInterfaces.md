# Functional Interfaces
In the Java programming language, a functional interface is an interface that has only one abstract method. Functional interfaces are a key component of the functional programming capabilities introduced in Java 8 with the addition of lambda expressions and the `java.util.function` package.

The concept of functional interfaces in Java is closely related to the concept of lambda expressions and supports the implementation of functional programming principles. By defining functional interfaces, Java enables developers to use lambda expressions as a concise and expressive way to represent behavior as data.

Key characteristics of a functional interface in Java include:

1. Single Abstract Method (SAM): A functional interface must declare exactly one abstract method. This method represents the behavior encapsulated by the interface. It is the only method that needs to be implemented by the implementing class or provided as a lambda expression.

2. Default and Static Methods: A functional interface can have default and static methods in addition to the single abstract method. Default methods provide default implementations, whereas static methods are utility methods that can be invoked directly on the interface.

3. Functional Interface Annotation: To ensure that an interface is explicitly designated as a functional interface, the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation is used. This annotation is optional but recommended. It helps avoid accidental addition of extra abstract methods, triggering a compilation error if more than one abstract method is declared within an annotated interface.

The `java.util.function` package in Java provides a set of predefined functional interfaces that cover common use cases in functional programming, such as predicates, consumers, suppliers, and functions with different numbers and types of parameters. 

A functional interface can be implemented via a lambda expression if desired. This can be handy if the programmer simply needs an object of the interface type for a short period of time.

The code below defines a functional interface.

```java
public interface SomeFunctionalInterface {
    public int squareANumber( int val);
}
```

If this interface were to be used in some other program, the lambda expression implementaion  of the interface might look like this:

```java
... some code here

//creating a variable of the interface type
SomeFunctionalInterface variableName = (int theParameter) ->  theParameter * theParameter;

//using the interface type object

int theAnswer = theVariable.squareANumber(6);

```
Note that we did not create a class to implement the interface.  That isn't necessary if the interface is functional and if the object doesn't need to be wrapped in other objects.

Functional interfaces, combined with lambda expressions, provide a concise and expressive way to encapsulate behavior and pass it as an argument or assign it to variables. They enable functional programming-style coding in Java and are widely used in stream operations, event handling, and asynchronous programming, among other scenarios.
